| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This package of Radicale 1.x is only provided so that storage can be
exported before updating to a newer version.

Before upgrading to Radicale 2+, run
'${PREFIX}/bin/radicale --export-storage /path/to/storage'.

You can then 'pkg_delete radicale' to remove the existing version, and
install a newer version with 'pkg_add radicale', selecting the newer
version from the list.

This exported storage can be used directly by Radicale 2 after the
upgrade.
