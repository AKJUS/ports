Blend2D is a high performance 2D vector graphics engine written in C++
and released under the Zlib license. The engine utilizes a built-in JIT
compiler to generate optimized pipelines at runtime that take the
advantage of host CPU features and is capable of using multiple threads
to boost the performance beyond the possibilities of single-threaded
rendering. Blend2D can render rectangles, simple shapes, geometries
composed of lines and BÃ©zier curves, and text. The 2D pipeline supports
pixel composition, opacity control, and styles such as solid colors,
gradients, and images.
