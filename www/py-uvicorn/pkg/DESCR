Uvicorn is an ASGI web server implementation for Python.

Until recently Python has lacked a minimal low-level server/application
interface for async frameworks. The ASGI specification fills this gap,
and means we're now able to start building a common set of tooling
usable across all async frameworks.

Uvicorn supports HTTP/1.1 and WebSockets.
