lap is a linear assignment problem solver using Jonker-Volgenant
algorithm for dense LAPJV or sparse LAPMOD matrices. Both algorithms are
implemented from scratch based solely on the papers and the public
domain Pascal implementation provided by A. Volgenant. The LAPMOD
implementation seems to be faster than the LAPJV implementation for
matrices with a side of more than ~5000 and with less than 50% finite
coefficients.
