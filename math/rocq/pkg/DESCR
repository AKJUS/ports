The Rocq Prover, formerly known as the Coq Proof Assistant, is an
interactive theorem prover, or proof assistant. It provides a formal
language to write mathematical definitions, executable algorithms
and theorems together with an environment for semi-interactive
development of machine-checked proofs.
