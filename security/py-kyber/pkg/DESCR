Contains pure Python implementations of:

* ML-KEM, the Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism
  following FIPS 203 from the NIST post-quantum cryptography project.

* CRYSTALS-Kyber following its specification v3.02.

Being pure Python, this code is not constant time, nor written to be
performant. No cryptographic guarantees are made.
