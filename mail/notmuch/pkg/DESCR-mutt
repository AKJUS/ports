notmuch-mutt provide integration among the Mutt mail user agent and the Notmuch
mail indexer.

notmuch-mutt offer two main integration features. The first one is the ability
of stating a search query interactively and then jump to a fresh Maildir
containing its search results only. The second one is the ability to
reconstruct threads on the fly starting from the currently highlighted mail,
which comes handy when a thread has been split across different maildirs,
archived, or the like.
