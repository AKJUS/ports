This is a Python implementation of the Unicode Collation Algorithm
which can be used to order non-English strings.

The core of the algorithm involves multi-level comparison. For
example, ``caf√©`` comes before ``caff`` because at the primary
level, the accent is ignored and the first word is treated as if
it were ``cafe``. The secondary level (which considers accents)
only applies then to words that are equivalent at the primary level.
