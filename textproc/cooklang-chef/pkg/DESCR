chef is a CLI to manage, read and convert cooklang recipes.

Cooklang is a markup language for cooking recipes. An in depth
explanation can be found in cooklang.org.

Key features:

* Web UI. The CLI comes with an embedded web UI.
* Ingredient references. You can now refer to ingredients you
  already used before.
* Good error reporting. Error reports are a top priority.
* Units. An ingredient quantity means nothing without a unit.
  This is why the units are parsed and checked. With units come:
  o Unit conversion. You can read your recipe in your prefered
    unit system.
  o Configurable units. You can add, remove and rename units.
