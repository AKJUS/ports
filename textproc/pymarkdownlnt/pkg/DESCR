Command-line tool written in Python for linting Markdown files.

It comes with 46 out-of-the-box rules to check Markdown files, 44 of which are
modified versions of the rules provided by the Markdown Lint project.

Please note that while the project mostly refers to itself as "PyMarkdown",
the port name follows the pypi package name, "markdownlint" to distinguish from
existing projects with similar names: "Python-Markdown", "pymarkdown".
