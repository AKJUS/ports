gotsysd(8) is the Game of Trees System management daemon.

gotsysd(8) allows managing a gotd(8) server without having direct shell
access to the OpenBSD system which runs gotd(8). Service administrators
manage the gotd(8) server by committing changes to gotsys.conf(5) in the
special gotsys.git repository, rather than via a root shell.

gotsysd(8) supports the creation of Git repositories, the creation of
user accounts running gotsh(1), setting repository access permissions,
and more.
