git send-email
==============
To make it work with SSL/TLS and SMTP auth you have to install
the following additional packages.

	p5-Net-SMTP-SSL
	p5-Authen-SASL

CPU count detection
===================
To improve performance on OpenBSD systems with many CPUs, this package
is patched to cap the number of detected CPUs at a maximum of 4, to avoid
the kernel spending significant time in spin locks. This can be overridden
to increase or decrease if wanted in ${SYSCONFDIR}/gitconfig, e.g.

[grep]
	threads = 8
[index]
	threads = 8
[pack]
	threads = 8
