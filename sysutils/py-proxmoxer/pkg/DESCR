Proxmoxer is a python wrapper around the Proxmox REST API v2.
It currently supports the Proxmox services of Proxmox Virtual
Environment (PVE), Proxmox Mail Gateway (PMG), and Proxmox
Backup Server (PBS).

It was inspired by slumber, but it is dedicated only to Proxmox.
It allows not only REST API use over HTTPS, but the same api over
ssh and pvesh utility.
