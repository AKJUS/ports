This is a tool, which tests mirror speed for some Linux distributives,
OpenBSD and any http/https mirrors via stdin.

It uses info about submarine cables and internet exchanges (kudos to
TeleGeography for data) to jump between countries and find fast mirrors.
And it's fast enough to run it before each system update (~30 seconds
with default options).
