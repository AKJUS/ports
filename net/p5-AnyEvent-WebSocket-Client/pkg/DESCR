Interface for interacting with a web server that offers services via
the WebSocket protocol in an AnyEvent context. It uses
Protocol::WebSocket rather than reimplementing the protocol. While it
is possible to use AnyEvent and Protocol::WebSocket directly for
finer-grained control, this class offers a convenient abstraction
when such control is not required.
