| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting Started
===============

The following information includes notes specific to use on OpenBSD. Use
them in conjunction with the main Icinga DB documentation available in
${PREFIX}/share/doc/icingadb/doc
or online at
https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-db/

It is important to have an understanding of the components that will be
in use with Icinga DB before beginning the configuration of Icinga DB. A
Redis or another protocol-compatible server is required, which needs to
be configured in both Icinga 2 and Icinga DB. A database - MySQL or
PostgreSQL - is also required and must be configured in both Icinga DB
and Icinga DB Web.

If not already done, these services must be installed, perhaps on the
same machine. They are available from packages.

The database must be configured. Please refer to the documentation
section "Setting up the Database" in
${PREFIX}/share/doc/icingadb/doc/02-Installation.md
or online at
https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-db/latest/doc/02-Installation/Debian/#setting-up-the-database

Afterwards, a database schema must be imported. Schema and updates for
MySQL and PostgreSQL are found in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/icingadb/schema/.

Before starting Icinga DB, the installed sample configuration at
${SYSCONFDIR}/icingadb/config.yml should now be altered accordingly to your setup.
See the documentation in
${PREFIX}/share/doc/icingadb/doc/03-Configuration.md
or online at
https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-db/latest/doc/03-Configuration/

Enable Icinga DB at boot and start it as usual:

  # rcctl enable icingadb
  # rcctl start icingadb

Icinga 2 Integration
--------------------

The following section should be read in parallel with the official
Debian-specific documentation, available online at
https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-2/latest/doc/02-installation/01-Debian/#set-up-icinga-db

The Icinga 2 installation needs the icingadb feature enabled.

  # doas -u _icinga icinga2 feature enable icingadb

This results in an IcingaDB object becoming available under
${SYSCONFDIR}/icinga2/features-enabled/icingadb.conf

Depending on your setup it might be necessary to alter this file
according to the documentation available online at
https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-2/latest/doc/09-object-types/#icingadb

Please note, Icinga 2's IcingaDB default port is be 6380, which is not
equal to the Redis default port of 6379.

Finally, restart Icinga 2:

  # rcctl restart icinga2

Icinga Web 2 Integration
------------------------

To integrate Icinga DB into Icinga Web 2, install the icingadb-web package
and follow its pkg-readme. This can either be run instead of the standard
"monitoring" module, or alongside it.

Upgrading Icinga DB
===================

Follow the main documentation in
${PREFIX}/share/doc/icingadb/doc/04-Upgrading.md
or online at
https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-db/latest/doc/04-Upgrading/

If a schema update is required, this is stated in the CHANGELOG and
Upgrading documentation. The file itself will be available under
${PREFIX}/share/examples/icingadb/schema/{mysql,pgsql}/upgrades/
and is named after the new Icinga DB version.

It can be applied like the following example:

  # doas -u _icingadb psql -U icingadb icingadb < ${PREFIX}/share/examples/icingadb/schema/pgsql/upgrades/1.2.3.sql

Please note that all intermediate upgrades are required!
