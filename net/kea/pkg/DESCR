Kea aims to provide a high-performance, extensible DHCP server engine
for use by enterprises and service providers, either as-is or with
extensions and modifications.

It includes DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers, a dynamic DNS update module,
a portable DHCP library, and perfdhcp (a DHCP benchmarking tool).
